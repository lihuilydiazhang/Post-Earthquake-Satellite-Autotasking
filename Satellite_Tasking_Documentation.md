# Post Earthquake Satellite Autotasking Project
This document serves as an alternative to the Jupyter Notebook, providing a static representation of code and examples for user runability. The goal is to enable users with a satellite tasking API to easily understand and run the provided code, ensuring it is accessible to a wide range of users without specific software requirements.

Code examples and explanations related to satellite tasking after an earthquake will be provided here.
