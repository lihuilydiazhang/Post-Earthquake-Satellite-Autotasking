# Post-Earthquake-Satellite-Autotasking

## What is this project?
Imagine your work involves locating the most recent natural disasters, along with their detailed coordinates, to acquire before and after satellite imagery for disaster relief efforts.

The most time-consuming part of this task is finding the exact coordinates of the disaster-struck locations. Typically, this involves manual browsing of newspapers, refreshing social media feeds, and contacting local sources.

To address this challenge, this project was developed. It automatically searches for the most recent earthquakes around the world using data from the US Geological Survey (USGS). It parses and extracts the coordinate locations of these events and then interfaces with Google Earth Engine to retrieve the most recent satellite imagery from its archive, all without requiring human intervention.

## How was this project developed?
The Jupyter Notebook in the above folder contains code to explore and access satellite imagery following an earthquake. The goal is to automate the process of capturing images for earthquake-affected areas using data from the USGS's Latest Earthquake Program and the satellite archive from Google Earth Engine.

Functioning codes are contained in: "Post_Earthquake_Satellite_Autotasking.ipynb" (3rd item in above folder)
