# Post-Earthquake-Satellite-Autotasking

This project is to automate the process of satellite images acquisition for earthquake-affected areas using USGS's Latest Earthquake Program and Google Earth Engine's LandSAT Archive.

## An overview of the methods are as follows:
1. Leverage credible data source by USGS Latest Earthquakes Program API, which contains earthquakes list (past 24 hours, M2.5+) from the Advanced National Seismic System.
2. Explore Google Earth Engineâ€™s (GEE) vast satellite archive to query and identify most recent imageries over the disaster location.  
3. Utilize Python and related geospatial packages to create a workflow - linking the USGS API with GEE API - that is automated, scable, and accurate.
